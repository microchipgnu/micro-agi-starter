      "result": "# Apple: The Technology Giant\n\nApple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. It was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976. Originally named Apple Computer, the company's mission statement at that time was \"to put a personal computer on every desk and in every home.\" Apple revolutionized the computers, digital publishing, and most recently the mobile devices through its innovative hardware and software offerings.\n\n## History\nApple started as a partnership between Jobs and Wozniak, who together assembled the first Apple I computer in Jobs' garage in April 1976. By the following year, they had renamed the company Apple Computer Inc., and it went public in December 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next decade and a half, Apple shipped a number of influential computers, including the Apple II (introduced in 1977), the Macintosh (1984), the PowerBook duo (1991), and the PowerMac G3 (1999).\n\n## Products & Services\nToday, Apple's main product lines include:\n\n- **iPhone**: A line of smartphones that use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The iPhone was introduced in 2007 by then-CEO Steve Jobs and has since become one of the best-selling consumer electronics in history.\n- **iPad**: A line of tablet computers that runs on iPadOS, a modified version of macOS. Introduced in 2010, the iPad's market dominance, along with the iPhone, has made Apple the world's second-largest PC vendor by unit sales and total revenue, behind Lenovo.\n- **Mac**: A series of all-in-one desktop computers and laptops that use macOS as their primary operating system. The Mac line was introduced in 1984 with the original Macintosh computer. Apple's laptops are particularly renowned for their portability, power, design, and build quality.\n- **iPod**: A series of portable media players designed and marketed by Apple. Introduced in 2001, it was a key player in the early digital media revolution before being replaced with the iPhone's capabilities.\n- **Apple Watch**: A line of smartwatches which use watchOS as their operating system. Introduced in April 2015, Apple Watch has been described as a \"truly modern computer for your wrist.\"\n- **Apple TV**: A digital media player and microconsole that can receive and stream media content to a television or other display devices. The device is primarily used for streaming movies and TV shows from iTunes and third-party services, playing music, and accessing apps and games.\n- **Services**: Apple's diverse portfolio of services includes the App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and iWork & iLife Suite. These services complement and expand upon the offerings of Apple's hardware.\n\n## Impact\nApple has greatly influenced the technology industry and popular culture in its nearly 50-year history. Its products have been cited as being instrumental in shaping the PC revolution in the late 1970s, popularizing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) used by modern operating systems, and redefining portable media players, smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. Apple's corporate slogan, \"Think different,\" has become a motivational phrase.\n\nAs of 2021, Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue. This ranking is mainly due to the success of its iPhone line of products. The company also maintains a significant market capitalization and profitability, making it one of the most valuable publicly-traded companies in the world.",
